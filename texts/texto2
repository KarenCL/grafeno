A smartphone is a cellular telephone with an integrated computer and other features not originally associated with telephones, such as an operating system, Web browsing and the ability to run software applications. The first smartphone was IBM's Simon, which was presented as a concept device (rather than a consumer device) at the 1992 COMDEX computer industry trade show.
