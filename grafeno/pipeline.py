The pipeline module allows the user to write full pipelines of experiments in a
dict, which can then be loaded and run by the library with one function call::

   from grafeno import pipeline

   experiment = {
       'text': 'Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.',
       'transformers': [ 'all' ],
       'linearizers': [ 'triplets' ]
   }

   result = pipeline.run(experiment)
   print(result)

Pipeline Formatting
-------------------
The following attributes for the pipeline dict are supported.

.. note::

    The pipeline is designed so that it can be easily serialized and loaded
    from a string format such as YAML, making repeatable experiments as easy
    as writing into a text file what operations to perform, and with what
    arguments.

.. rubric:: Input
Input to the pipeline is required, it can be either a `graph`, or both `text`
and `transformers`.

- `graph`: a :py:mod:`Graph <grafeno.graph>`
- `text`: a raw natural language text
- `transformers`: list of transformer names to use (see :py:mod:`grafeno.transformers`)
- `transformer_args`: dict of arguments for the `transformers`

.. rubric:: Operation
- `operations`: a list of dicts, each with an ``op`` attribute with the
  operation name, and the rest of the arguments to be used as parameters for
  the operation.

.. rubric:: Output
A text if a `linearizers` attribute is present, otherwise the raw `graph`
obtained is returned.

- `linearizers`: list of linearizer names to use (see :py:mod:`grafeno.linearizers`)
- `linearizer_args`: dict of arguments for the linearizers

.. seealso::

    Some pre-built pipelines can be found in the ``config`` directory,
    written in YAML: :ref:`configs`.
