class Transformer:
    '''This class is the basic transformer class. Other transformers should
    inherit from it either directly or indirectly.

    Transformer composition in `grafeno` uses cooperative inheritance. When a
    new module is written, it should extend the base class, or it can extend one
    or more other transformers which provide some required functionality. This
    is a way of managing dependencies, since the base classes will be inserted
    by Python into the inheritance chain.

    The new module can then extend the methods it is interested in, adding
    some processing to that stage. However, for the chaining to work, every
    extended method has to make sure to:

    1. Call ``super()`` with the correct (original) arguments at the very beggining of the function body.
    2. Return the appropriate value, either modified, or untouched as returned from ``super()``.

    Some attributes are present in the transformer during processing. They can
    be used and modified in the appropriate stages.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : :py:mod:`Graph <grafeno.graph>`
        The graph to which all transformed text will be added.

    Attributes
    ----------
    graph : :py:mod:`Graph <grafeno.graph>`
        The graph to which all transformed text will be added.
    stage : string
        Useful for debugging or checking, this string denotes what stage the
        processing is currently in.
    nodes : dict of :ref:`semantic nodes <semantic_nodes>`
        Available from pre_process up to post_process.
        Map of semantic nodes obtained for the sentence being processed, indexed
        by id.
    edges : list of :ref:`semantic edges <semantic_edges>`
        Available from pre_process up to post_process.
        List of semantic edges obtained for the sentence being processed.
